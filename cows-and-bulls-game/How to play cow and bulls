I have made a fun game with simple python .
It generate a random 4 digit number.
You have to give a an input for 7 times that are your seven guesses .
Your guesses should not have more than 4 digit 
Your guess should not contain a 0 in it 
When you have a output of 4 cow,  congrats you won. 
Enjoy playing.
